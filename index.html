              <h2>What is Minesweeper?</h2>
              <p>Minesweeper is a logic-based puzzle game where the goal is to clear a board without detonating any hidden mines. Each tile gives you clues about how many mines are nearby.</p>
            </div>
          
            <div class="section">
              <h2>History</h2>
              <p>Minesweeper has its roots in early logic-based computer games from the 1960s and 1970s, inspired by classic pen-and-paper puzzles. One of the first digital versions was “Mined-Out” (1983) for the ZX Spectrum. These early games featured similar mechanics: uncover cells while avoiding hidden mines.

                The game became globally popular when Microsoft included it in Windows 3.1 in 1992, as a way to help users practice right-clicking with a mouse. This version, developed by Robert Donner and Curt Johnson, featured a clean interface, a timer, and three difficulty levels.
                
                Despite its simplicity, Minesweeper became iconic—known for its blend of logic, strategy, and risk. Over the years, it evolved with new versions, including 3D variants and competitive speedrunning. Today, it remains a classic puzzle game, celebrated for its timeless challenge and nostalgic value.</p>

              <h2>Tips for Winning</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Start from a corner or edge—this often opens up more space.</li>
                <li>Use numbers and logic to deduce where mines are located.</li>
                <li>Mark suspected mines with flags, but don’t guess unless you must.</li>
                <li>Look for common patterns such as "1-2-1" or "1-1" combinations.</li>
                <li>Use both left and right click together to quickly reveal safe zones.</li>
              </ul>
